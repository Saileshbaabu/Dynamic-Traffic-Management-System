## Abstract
The Smart Traffic Management System is a pivotal component of a Smart City, addressing the pressing issue of urban mobility. In metropolitan areas, people spend an average of 243 hours per year in traffic, leading to delays, stress, increased fuel consumption, and air pollution. This proposed system employs computer vision to count vehicles from traffic camera images, optimizing traffic light switching based on real-time vehicle density. Additionally, it incorporates license plate recognition for traffic monitoring and a sound detector to prioritize emergency vehicles. The system aims to reduce congestion, enhance transit efficiency, and contribute to environmental sustainability.

## Technology / Components Employed
- Generic Road Track Monitoring System
- Siren Detector
- Automatic License Plate Recognition

## Working Principle: YOLO
The system utilizes the YOLO ("You Only Look Once") object detection technique to identify objects in video frames and the SORT (Simple Online and Real-time Tracking algorithm) for object tracking. Through mathematical calculations, the system counts intersections between the vehicle's previous and current frame positions with a defined line.

## Key Outcomes
- Installation of Adaptive traffic signal control at lane intersections to address high traffic congestion.
- Equitable distribution of green phase (traffic signal) time and swift response to traffic conditions and emergencies.
- Prediction of traffic volumes for adjusting signal timings.

  
## Impacts
The project aims to improve travel time reliability, reduce congestion, and minimize Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.
